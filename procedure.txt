So here i am going to Explain the procedure to make your project working......

Lets Begin!!....

Step-1:-You need to have the following components ready to execute the project successfully.
       -Arduino Uno
       -Jumper wires
       -Buzzer
       -USB to arduino connection cord
       -Water Sensor.

Step-2:-To check if the water sensor is able to deliver the result we need.

-Connect 5V on the arduino board to the + Terminal of the Water sensor.Connect the ground pin to - Terminal on the Water sensor and finally connect the A0 analog pin to S terminal on the water sensor.
-Run the initial.ino code which is given in the repository and upload it to the arduino board.
-Now dip the water sensor in water and check the reading change in the serial monitor.
-The Readings Change.....

Step-3:-Connecting the Buzzer

-Connect the +ve of the buzzer (red wire) to any digital pin from 1-13.
-Connect the -ve of the buzzer (black wire) to the ground.
-Now run the AnalogInOutSerial.ino code which is given in the repository and upload it to the arduino board.
-Dip the Sensor in water and now you will see the buzzer in action!

Step-4:-Share the project with your friends!!
